					<p>Hello! My name is Michelle Lawson and I live, work and play in the greater Puget Sound area of Washington State. I have been significantly overweight for most of my adult life. Like many of us, 					my behavior pattern is to become resolved to get slender and healthy, stick with it for a while then "relapse" into old behavior, usually putting any weight I lost back on, sometimes plus more.</p>
						
		    		<p>I am a huge believer in Weight Watchers, because its an entire lifestyle and mindset change, not a quick fix solution that is not livable. I joined (again) this past Monday, April 9, 2018 and am 					giving it my all. This determination comes from several areas:</p>
		    		<ul>
		    	   		<li><strong><em>Overall Health: </em></strong>I want to live a long, healthy life, and lower my risk of obesity related diseases.</li>
		    	   		<li><strong><em>Joint Health: </em></strong>I recently had to have both knees replaced due to severe osteoarthritis, so I want to improve the health of my other joints.</li> 	    	    
		    		</ul>

	  	  			<h2>Three days til weigh-in....and....SUNDRESSES!!!!</h2>
	  			</div><!--post-title OK-->
	  		
	  			<div class="post-text"><!--post-text OK-->
					<p>I weigh in on Saturday. I've been rocking the sundresses lately. I've had them for three years and haven't been able to wear them for two. It feels so good to feel feminine again. I call it 						"girling it up".  Like I said before, I hate that our sense of self esteem is so wrapped up in our appearance but its such an engrained belief, I don't know if I can break it. And maybe I don't 						need to. Maybe I just need to enjoy feeling good about how I look!!</p>
						
						<p>I've done really well, even tracked my splurges (which were covered by my weeklies, yay!) But last night I just couldn't get full and I'm pretty sure I went way over 									my allowance, even taking weeklies into account. I'm hoping that if I stay in my daily point allowance until Saturday it will balance out. I made a committment to start walking a few miles 						daily, after finding out that I am capable of walking that far (I had to walk up to the store when I didnt have my car while on vacation in California and was shocked I was able to easily walk 						two miles!) Its been too hot and I've been too busy to walk in the week since I've been home. I'm short on time today but I'm pledging to start tomorrow!!! That should help too.</p>

	  	  			<h2>The dangers of frozen yogurt bars PAH</h2>
	  			</div><!--post-title OK-->
	  		
	  			<div class="post-text"><!--post-text OK-->
					<p>I bought some Skinny Cow lowfat frozen yogurt bars last night. They are a little point-heavy at 5 points each but one some days I should be able to fit them in, even if I have to use my 						weeklies.</p>
					<p>They are my favorite flavor, Salted Caramel. Everyone should be able to get a lifetime supply of salted carmel treats at birth. But I wasn't expecting much from them. I figured they couldn't be 					as good ad real ice cream bars. Boy, I couldn't have been more wrong. They are SCRUMPTIOUS. I ate 2 when I only meant to eat one. Can anyone relate? They fit into my points okay because I made the 					mistake of not eating enough during the day, but boy I need to be careful, those things are dangerous. I can see myself having a major pig out on them. Who pigs out on lowfat stuff? This girl, if 					its tasty enough.</p>
					
					<p>I'm really feeling good about my progress. I feel like girling it up so I'm wearing a pretty sundress today. I did my nails and put makeup on. Its sad that in this society its so easy to have 					your self worth and self esteem tied up in how you look. I fight it, but its a lifelong pattern so I'm not sure to what degree I'll be able to overcome it.</p>.
					<p>I hope you all have a spectacular day!</p>

				Boy, its been a long time since I started this page, and I haven't kept it up. Since that last post, I have lost a total of 30lbs since October 2017. I only started working hard again this past May so 				I've lost 16lbs since then, and the other 14lbs between October 2017 and May 2018. Thats 16lbs in 3 months...I'll take it!
				
				I made a delicious Coconut Chickpea Curry yesterday. 
				<p><img src="dsh-chickpea-curry.jpg" alt="chickpea curry"></p>
				<p>I found the recipe online and added broccoli and carrots to it. Its in the WW app. I got it<a href="https://www.saltandlavender.com/quick-easy-chickpea-coconut-curry/"> here</a>.</p>
