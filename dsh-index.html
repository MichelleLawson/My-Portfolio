					<p>Hello! My name is Michelle Lawson and I live, work and play in the greater Puget Sound area of Washington State. I have been significantly overweight for most of my adult life. Like many of us, 					my behavior pattern is to become resolved to get slender and healthy, stick with it for a while then "relapse" into old behavior, usually putting any weight I lost back on, sometimes plus more.</p>
						
		    		<p>I am a huge believer in Weight Watchers, because its an entire lifestyle and mindset change, not a quick fix solution that is not livable. I joined (again) this past Monday, April 9, 2018 and am 					giving it my all. This determination comes from several areas:</p>
		    		<ul>
		    	   		<li><strong><em>Overall Health: </em></strong>I want to live a long, healthy life, and lower my risk of obesity related diseases.</li>
		    	   		<li><strong><em>Joint Health: </em></strong>I recently had to have both knees replaced due to severe osteoarthritis, so I want to improve the health of my other joints.</li> 	    	    
		    		</ul>

	  			</div><!--post-title OK-->
	  		
	  			<div class="post-text"><!--post-text OK-->
					<p>Boy, you guys...I've been on a food rampage the last 2-3 months. I'm disappointed in myself but I'm trying to be as kind to myself as I would to another person who fell off the WW wagon. I've lost some, I've gained some, and I guess considering how off plan I've been its not as bad as it could have been. Wednesday I put on my big girl pants and weigh in at 9:30. If I've gained, I've gained and I will try not to let it discourage me.</p>
					
					<p>I would like to hear about others' experiences with falling off then getting back on plan. I am still trying to figure out how to create a comment section, but in the meantime, please post in the Winners-At-Losing group or send me a private message! Hearing other people's experiences might help me!</p>

	  	  			<h2>The dangers of frozen yogurt bars</h2>
	  			</div><!--post-title OK-->
	  		
	  			<div class="post-text"><!--post-text OK-->
					<p>I bought some Skinny Cow lowfat frozen yogurt bars last night. They are a little point-heavy at 5 points each but one some days I should be able to fit them in, even if I have to use my 						weeklies.</p>
					<p>They are my favorite flavor, Salted Caramel. Everyone should be able to get a lifetime supply of salted carmel treats at birth. But I wasn't expecting much from them. I figured they couldn't be 					as good ad real ice cream bars. Boy, I couldn't have been more wrong. They are SCRUMPTIOUS. I ate 2 when I only meant to eat one. Can anyone relate? They fit into my points okay because I made the 					mistake of not eating enough during the day, but boy I need to be careful, those things are dangerous. I can see myself having a major pig out on them. Who pigs out on lowfat stuff? This girl, if 					its tasty enough.</p>
					
					<p>I'm really feeling good about my progress. I feel like girling it up so I'm wearing a pretty sundress today. I did my nails and put makeup on. Its sad that in this society its so easy to have 					your self worth and self esteem tied up in how you look. I fight it, but its a lifelong pattern so I'm not sure to what degree I'll be able to overcome it.</p>.
					<p>I hope you all have a spectacular day!</p>

				Boy, its been a long time since I started this page, and I haven't kept it up. Since that last post, I have lost a total of 30lbs since October 2017. I only started working hard again this past May so 				I've lost 16lbs since then, and the other 14lbs between October 2017 and May 2018. Thats 16lbs in 3 months...I'll take it!
				
				I made a delicious Coconut Chickpea Curry yesterday.
