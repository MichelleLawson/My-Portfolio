					<p>I weigh in on Saturday. I've been rocking the sundresses lately. I've had them for three years and haven't been able to wear them for two. It feels so good to feel feminine again. I call it 						"girling it up".  Like I said before, I hate that our sense of self esteem is so wrapped up in our appearance but its such an engrained belief, I don't know if I can break it. And maybe I don't 						need to. Maybe I just need to enjoy feeling good about how I look!!</p>
						
						<p>I've done really well, even tracked my splurges (which were covered by my weeklies, yay!) But last night I just couldn't get full and I'm pretty sure I went way over 									my allowance, even taking weeklies into account. I'm hoping that if I stay in my daily point allowance until Saturday it will balance out. I made a committment to start walking a few miles 						daily, after finding out that I am capable of walking that far (I had to walk up to the store when I didnt have my car while on vacation in California and was shocked I was able to easily walk 						two miles!) Its been too hot and I've been too busy to walk in the week since I've been home. I'm short on time today but I'm pledging to start tomorrow!!! That should help too.</p>

					<p>Boy, you guys...I've been on a food rampage the last 2-3 months. I'm disappointed in myself but I'm trying to be as kind to myself as I would to another person who fell off the WW wagon.  Saturday I put on my big girl pants and weigh in at 9:30. I have to get back on plan. My future and my life depend on it.</p>
					
					<p>I would like to hear about others' experiences with falling off then getting back on plan. I am still trying to figure out how to create a comment section, but in the meantime, please post in the Winners-At-Losing group or send me a private message! Hearing other people's experiences might help me!</p>
